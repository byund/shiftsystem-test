At some point do the following....

-Change ShiftList "checkinTime" to "startTime". It makes much more sense.
-Ensure on the backend that an employee cannot sub for a shift that conflicts with their schedule.
-Ensure on the backend that an employee cannot checkin by posting directly to the page from an invalid ip address.
-Let ShiftSystem be accessible off campus.
-Remove Day column?
-Fix the checkintime->minutes late bug in currentShifts.
